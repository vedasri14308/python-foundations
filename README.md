# Python Foundations

This repository documents my journey learning Python from the basics.
I am focusing on understanding logic, not memorizing syntax.

Topics covered so far:
- Variables
- Data types (int, float, string)
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- While loops

Goal:
Build strong foundations for AI and Machine Learning.
